//TODO Define your core objective.



//TODO Give yourself a time frame to achieve the objective. 



//TODO Give your objective a measurable component so you’ll be able to tell whether or not you’ve achieved it in a few years or months.



//TODO Figure out how you actually plan to measure the measurable component. The two main options for most organizations will be: User self-reporting. (Surveying employees to ask about their behaviors) Device tracking. (Tracking employee behaviors via FitBit, etc.)



//TODO Figure out how to work toward that core objective by determining actions that would help you achieve it.
